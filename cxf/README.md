## Apache CXF JAX-RS Example

Industry leading open source Apache CXF (http://cxf.apache.org/) implementation of JAX-WS to help you service enable your existing applications and interfaces. The CXF lightweight, modular architecture is based on Spring, so it will work with your application regardless of the platform on which it is running. It will run on stand-alone JVM applications, as part of a servlet container such as JBoss/WildFly, Tomcat.

This package contains several new examples that show advanced features of CXF.  All of the examples are setup to be built and run independently, avaiable examples including:
